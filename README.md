#  Network Packet Analysis Reports
## Overview
This project showcases the analysis of 10 PCAP files using Wireshark, Snort, and NetworkMiner. Each capture was examined for protocol behavior, possible threats, and operating system fingerprints based on TTL values. The reports aim to highlight practical skills in network traffic analysis, incident detection, and documentation.
## Objective 
To gain hands-on experience in packet-level threat detection and documentation. This serves as both a learning exercise and a practical demonstration of traffic analysis skills applicable in blue team and red team roles.
## Tools Used
- Wireshark – Deep packet inspection and protocol analysis
- Snort – Intrusion detection system for signature-based alerting
